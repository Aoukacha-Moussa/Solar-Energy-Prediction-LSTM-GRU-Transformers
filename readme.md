# Solar Energy Prediction using LSTM, GRU, and Transformers

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Transformer models to predict solar energy output. The goal is to accurately predict the amount of solar energy that will be produced in the future, given historical data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following packages installed:

- numpy: For numerical computations
- matplotlib: For plotting graphs
- seaborn: For statistical data visualization
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- tensorflow: For machine learning and neural networks
- keras: For building and training the LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models
- sklearn: For data preprocessing and evaluation metrics

You can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn pandas tensorflow keras sklearn
```
## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set. The MSE is a measure of the quality of an estimatorâ€”it is always non-negative, and values closer to zero are better.
